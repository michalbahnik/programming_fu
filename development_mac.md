# Development on MacBook

Development on MacBook can be quite challenging fro developers used to Windows on Ubuntu systems. Here I gathered few tips to make the development more comfortable for me (mostly getting more similar to Windows/Ubuntu).

## Tips

* Switch `control` and `command` keys (in _Settings_).
* Install [`brew`](https://brew.sh).
  * Sooner or later, you'll find out commands like `cp`, `grep`, etc. are not 100% equivalent with their GNU implementation, then just download it from `brew`.
* Install custom terminal (i. e. [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2))
* [rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle): Extends window management keyboard shortcuts and enables sticky windows.
* [scroll-reverser](https://github.com/pilotmoon/Scroll-Reverser): Enables you to reverse scrolling on external (non-Apple) mouse, but keep natural scrolling on touchbar.
* [qView](https://github.com/jurplel/qView): Open-source simple image viewer.
